# RxParseCallback
Syntactic sugar to convert block based callbacks into RxSwift Observables


## Usage 

This makes adopting RxSwift in your project way easier!
Let's say you have an callback based API that you're tied to, but you want to get on the Rx gravy train

```swift
/// This is a real example from a codebase I've worked on. It wraps the Facebook SDK's login function
func login(withReadPermissions permissions: [String] = ["email", "public_profile", "user_friends"]) -> Observable<FBSDKLoginManagerLoginResult> {

  return ParseRxCallbacks.createWithCallback({ observer -> Void in
    FBSDKLoginManager().logIn(withReadPermissions: permissions, 
                              from: nil,
                              // the `handler` param is of type `(FBSDKLoginManagerLoginResult?, Error?) -> Swift.Void`, 
                              // and calling `ParseRxCallbacks.parseUnwrappedOptionalCallback(observer)` returns `(T?, Error?) -> Swift.Void`
                              // #connectingmagic
                              handler: ParseRxCallbacks.parseUnwrappedOptionalCallback(observer))
  })

}
```

## API

#### Creating an Observable
```swift
func createWithCallback(_ callback: @escaping ((AnyObserver<T>) -> Void)) -> Observable<T>
```
Allows you to create an observable from a block. This is the meat of this Âµ Library. Inside the callback, you get a `AnyObserver<T>`, to which you can send any events you want propogated through the returned `Observable<T>`

#### Convinience functions for parsing conventional callback based APIs
Most APIs have callbacks that look something like `(SuccessDataType?, Error?)`. So there are three functions that help parsing data out of that common pattern.

```swift 
func parseCallback<T>(_ observer: AnyObserver<T>) -> (T, Error?)
```
This works for callbacks that have callbacks that return `(SuccessDataType, Error?)`. So you pass in the `AnyObserver<T>` given to you from the `createWithCallback`, and it satisfies the type requirment of (T, Error?)


```swift 
func parseOptionalCallback<T>(_ observer: AnyObserver<T?>) -> (T?, Error?)
```
Same as above, but it accepts callbacks that pass in `(T?, Error?)` instead.

```swift 
func parseUnwrappedOptionalCallback<T>(_ observer: AnyObserver<T>) -> (T?, Error?)
```
Same as above, but it also goes ahead and (safely) unwraps the `T?` into a `T` if the error was nil. 
If both the error was `nil` and `T` turned , it sends an error through on the Observable, called `noObjectNorErrorIncluded`
